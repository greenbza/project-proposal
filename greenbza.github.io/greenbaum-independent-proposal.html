            <h2>Portfolio Site Development</h2>
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
                The purpose of this project is to build a personal portfolio website from the ground up in order to showcase work I have completed during my time at JMU and into the future. The website itself should be its own example of what I have learned and show off both design and technical skills. The website should follow the format of what a personal portfolio should look like and the content it should contain, while also being unique and showcasing my skills as a designer. On a resume, you can’t effectively show the work you have completed with full descriptions and photos. Because of this, it is important that this site is developed so that future employers, clients, or anyone interested in my work can view it using a clean website.
            </p>
            <h4>Project Goals</h4>
            <p>
                At the bare minimum, the project should meet the following goals:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creation of a portfolio website from the ground up that encapsulates all my work</li>
                <li>The portfolio should show off my work with photos, links, and descriptions</li>
                <li>The site will require a logo and design scheme</li>
                <li>The site is easy for users to navigate and accounts for accessibility and user preferences. This will require user testing to make sure the site meets this goal.</li>
                <li>The site is future proof so that it can be added to as I complete more projects throughout the semester (capstone &amp; user research project)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>What I Hope to Learn</h4>
            <p>
                As part of the creation of the portfolio website, I will need to learn some new skills to assist in the site’s creation.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bootstrap to help with the website's development</li>
                <li>What goes into a proper portfolio website</li>
                <li>Advanced HTML/CSS techniques to create a unique website that also adheres to accessibility and user preferences</li>
                <li>How to purchase a domain name and host a personal website</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Audience</h4>
            <p>
                It is important that my portfolio appeals to the primary target audience: employers. The purpose of the website is to showcase my work in order to assist me in getting a job after I graduate JMU. The site should also appeal to other potential audiences, such as clients or anyone else interested in viewing my work, such as professors and peers. The following personas were assembled to create an idea of the audience I will be designing for.
